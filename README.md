# WRO2023 Tech Zone
 The official repository of the team "Tech Zone" for World Robot Olympiad 2023 Panama in the Future Engineer category. At this repository you can see all of our documentation

## Documentation
We have used two microcontrollers in our robot. 
- An Arduino Uno for controlling the hardware like Motors, Ultrasonic Sensors, Servos etc 
- A Rapberry Pi 3B for Image Processing and other internal processings. 

Raspberry Pi and Arduino will be communication with Serial Communication. Raspberry Pi has four files:

- ``main.py`` - This is the main script that wi
- ``serial_comm.py`` - This file contains code for communicating between Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- ``utils.py`` - This script holds many necessary functions for other scripts
- ``image_processing.py`` - This script contains code for Image Processing
